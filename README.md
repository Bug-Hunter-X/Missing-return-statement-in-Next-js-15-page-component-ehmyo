# Missing Return Statement in Next.js 15 Page Component

This repository demonstrates a common error in Next.js 15: a missing `return` statement in a page component.  Next.js 15 is stricter about the structure of page components, and omitting the `return` statement results in a runtime error.

## The Problem

The `pages/about.js` file lacks a `return` statement in the `About` component. This causes Next.js to throw an error because it expects a JSX element to be returned.  

## The Solution

The `pages/aboutSolution.js` file shows the corrected version, including a `return` statement that renders a simple heading.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the Next.js development server.
4. Navigate to `/about`. You'll observe the error with the original code and correct behavior after the fix.
